                <h3>"Onsite HHO gas generation system"</h3>
                <p >
                   <b> Overview:</b> the project as an innovative approach to alternative energy in the automotive industry. The system is designed to generate hydroxy gas (HHO) directly within the vehicle, offering a cleaner and more sustainable alternative to traditional fuels.<br>

                    <b>Key Features:</b><br>
                    
                    <b>Onsite HHO gas generation system:</b> The system generates hydroxy gas  at onsite as required, eliminating the need for storage and optimizing fuel usage.<br>
                    Advanced Control System: Utilizing pulsating signals to manage electrolytes, the system ensures a corrosion-free operation, enhancing durability and efficiency.<br>
                    High-Efficiency Combustion: The produced hydroxy gas boasts a high calorific value, resulting in superior combustion efficiency and reduced reliance on fossil fuels.<br>
                    <b>Impact:</b> This project represents a significant step toward cleaner and more efficient energy solutions in the automotive sector, promoting sustainability and reducing environmental impact.<br>

                <h3>"Website for reautaurents with feedback system"</h3>
                <p>I designed a comprehensive restaurant website featuring a feedback system, user account creation, and a fully functional food ordering page with a detailed menu. The site will highlight the restaurant's key offerings on the home page, include a categorized menu with search and cart options, and offer an ordering system with delivery and pickup choices. Users can create accounts to track orders, manage profiles, and leave ratings and reviews through an integrated feedback system. An admin panel will enable restaurant management to update the menu, monitor orders, and manage user feedback efficiently. The project utilizes modern web technologies, secure payment integrations, and a user-friendly design to enhance the online dining experience.</p>
